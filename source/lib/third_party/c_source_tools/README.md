## Cmake Generator Source Core in Python.  
This software can be used to generate a Cmake Make include file(**args['CmakeIncludes']**)
suitable for importing into the main(root)  
'CmakeLists.txt' with the following features:  
* Exclude file / folders as per exclude list paths  
* install header search paths as configured in arguments **args[application_libraries]**   
  add 'add_library' directive as configured in the arguments for each subfolder,  
  * recursively add each (sub)-subfolder via 'subdirs' if it contains Source  
    files as specified by **args['pattern']**  
  * Automatically generate the Library name & add all files in (sub)-subfolder  
    to the subfolder named library name basis path  
  * add a 'CmakeLists.txt' into the folder for each listed (sub)-subfolder  
  * ignores files / paths as specified in argument via **args['exclude']**  
  * add 'target_compile_definitions' for directory specific files    
  * Link all the included 'subfolders' via 'target_link_libraries' directives
